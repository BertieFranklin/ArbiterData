A note from the Founder and Owner of Arbiter Data Edward Franklin.


I started Arbiter Data to solve business problems using software.

My formative business experience was at PwC where I trained as Charterted Accountant. I went into dozens and dozens of businesses to check their accounts and associated records. Time and time again (no matter the size of the business, the ownership structure, the industry) I found records which were:
out of data,
incomplete,
contained errors,
confusing,
didn't contain what they were supposed to.

One of the dirty secrets of PwC is collecting, collating and tidying up this poor quality data is what actually takes up the vast amount of time of junior staff. I should know! I was one! 


After PwC I worked at a Fin-Tech start up Oxygen Finance where, among other things, I learnt about software which interfaces with accounting systems - such as ERPs - and how you get these systems to 'talk to each other' seamlessly in the background.

At Oxygen we had all the state of the art - and very expensive - Microsoft productivity tools such as SharePoint, OneDrive, PowerBI, Teams etc. But even with all the expensive software we ended up doing most of our work in various spreadsheets which were 'handed off' between various colleagues which would inevitably
get out of sync,
utterly confused,
and nobody was accountable as the spreadsheet had gone through so many people's hands.

The root cause of these problems isn't people as much as technology. And the technology is usually Excel, which suffers from virtually non-existant version control, accountability or auditability.

Managing these spreadsheets would end up consuming significant amounts of time as people would 'fudge the numbers' or 'make things work'. These unreliable spreadsheets would then create more disruption as people would waste time in meetings querying whether the numbers are right (which they usually weren't).

This problem of unreliable, confusing and time consuming spreadsheets is only getting worse due to the proliferation of data and the desire of business leaders to make data driven decisions.

There is a school of thought in IT which wants to get everything out of spreadsheets on people's local computers and host data on structured servers which people can access through web applications or mobile apps. I am sympathetic to this view. However it is view typically held by software engineers who don't have experience of managing real business processes like finance, HR and marketing. Time and time again when I went into businesses for PwC I would see finance staff working in spreadsheets even when they had 'proper' database system. This was typically because the database system was poorly designed and the staff didn't quite understand how it worked. And since everyone is familiar with Excel, staff would just resort to Excel instead of using the database properly.

Arbiter Data has a different philosophy to most software developers. Because I've received a conventional training in finance & accountancy I understand what finance staff actually do and how they think. And at Arbiter Data we build our software around our users - rather than building software which the software engineer likes (and forces the user to accept). And I know this because I started Arbiter Data by building software to help me in my own job. 

In practice Aribter Data's philosohpy means:
We make software which works seamlessly with Excel. 
We build software which is bespoke to your business, your processes, your terminology. Whether it is an automation tool made for a specific process for your business. Or a web application which imports, analyses, visualises and exports data specific to your business. With our software there is no need for "change management" or "transformation" becaue we build software which is designed around your business.

So perhaps you're making time consuming tables and graphs in Excel on a monthly basis for a report. Or you are using a spreadsheet to keep track of some important information (like leases, fixed assets, software licenses, holiday, share schemes) but get worried it might have errors in it. Or you've got a financial model in Excel which has got so big you aren't quite sure how it works and when you 'play around' with it it often crashes. Or you are using a spreadsheet to reconcile data from one system to another using various tricks like vlookups, index matches & sumifs. Then get in touch. At Arbiter Data we'll build something which will make your life easier.
