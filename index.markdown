Welcome to Arbiter Data. We are accountants turned software developers.

We know:
our debits from our credits,
our SQL from our Python,
our EBITDA from our EPS, and
our OLTP from our OLAP.

It is this unique combination of a deep understanding of finance and technology which allows Arbiter Data to deliver products and services that our competitors simply can't. We bridge the gap between finance and technology.

If you think your finance function could be improved with technology designed by accountants for accountants, then you are on the right website.
