A note from the Founder & Owner of Arbiter Data: Edward Franklin.


I started Arbiter Data to solve business problems using software.

My formative business experience was at PwC where I trained as a Charterted Accountant. I went into dozens and dozens of businesses to check their accounts and records. Time and time again - no matter the size, the industry, the place - I found records which were:

- out of date,

- incomplete,

- contained errors,

- confusing and

- didn't contain what they were supposed to.

After PwC I worked at a Fin-Tech where I learnt about software & accounting systems - such as ERPs - and how you get these systems to 'talk to each other'.

At this company we had state of the art - and very expensive - Microsoft productivity tools such as SharePoint, OneDrive, PowerBI, Teams etc. But even with all this we ended up doing most of our work in various spreadsheets which were 'handed off' between colleagues which would inevitably:

- get out of sync,

- become utterly confused,

- and end up with nobody being accountable as the spreadsheet had gone through so many people's hands.

The root cause of these problems isn't people. It is technology. And the technology is usually Excel, which suffers from:

- virtually non-existant version control,

- accountability

- or auditability.

Managing these spreadsheets would end up consuming significant amounts of time as people would 'fudge the numbers' or 'make things work'. These unreliable spreadsheets would then create more disruption as people would waste time in meetings querying whether the numbers were right (which they usually weren't).

This problem of unreliable, confusing and time consuming spreadsheets is only getting worse due to the proliferation of data and the desire of business leaders to make data driven decisions.
