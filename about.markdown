A note from the Founder & Owner of Arbiter Data: Edward Franklin.


I started Arbiter Data to solve business problems using software.

My formative business experience was at PwC where I trained as a Charterted Accountant. I went into dozens and dozens of businesses to check their accounts and records. Time and time again - no matter the size, the industry, the place - I found records which were:

- out of date,

- incomplete,

- contained errors,

- confusing and

- didn't contain what they were supposed to.

After PwC I worked at a Fin-Tech where I learnt about software & accounting systems - such as ERPs - and how you get these systems to 'talk to each other'.

At this company we had state of the art - and very expensive - Microsoft productivity tools such as SharePoint, OneDrive, PowerBI, Teams etc. But even with all this we ended up doing most of our work in various spreadsheets which were 'handed off' between colleagues which would inevitably:

- get out of sync,

- become utterly confused,

- and end up with nobody being accountable as the spreadsheet had gone through so many people's hands.

The root cause of these problems isn't people. It is technology. And the technology is usually Excel, which suffers from:

- virtually non-existant version control,

- accountability

- or auditability.

Managing these spreadsheets would end up consuming significant amounts of time as people would 'fudge the numbers' or 'make things work'. These unreliable spreadsheets would then create more disruption as people would waste time in meetings querying whether the numbers were right (which they usually weren't).

This problem of unreliable, confusing and time consuming spreadsheets is only getting worse due to the proliferation of data and the desire of business leaders to make data driven decisions.

There is a school of thought in IT which wants to get everything out of spreadsheets on people's local computers and host the data on structured servers instead. I am sympathetic to this view. However it is a view typically held by software engineers who tend not to have experience managing real business processes like finance, HR and marketing. Time and time again when I went into businesses for PwC I would see finance staff working in spreadsheets even when they had 'proper' database system. This was typically because the database system was poorly designed and the staff didn't quite understand how it worked. And since everyone is familiar with Excel, staff would resort to Excel instead of using the database properly.

Arbiter Data has a different philosophy to most software developers. Because I've received a conventional training in finance & accountancy I understand what finance staff actually do and how they think. 

In practice Aribter Data's philosohpy means:

- We make software which works with Excel. 
- We build software which is bespoke to your business, your processes, your terminology. Whether it is an automation tool made for a specific process in your business. Or a web application to imports, analyse, visualise and export data specific to your business. With our software there is no need for "change management" or "transformation" becaue we build software which is designed around your business.

So perhaps you're making time consuming tables and graphs in Excel on a monthly basis for a report. Or you are using a spreadsheet to keep track of some important information (like leases, fixed assets, software licenses, holiday, share schemes) but get worried it might have errors in it. Or you've got a financial model in Excel which has got so big you aren't quite sure how it works and when you 'play around' with it, it often crashes. Or you are using a spreadsheet to reconcile data from one system to another using various tricks like vlookups, index matches & sumifs. Then get in touch. At Arbiter Data we'll build something which will make your life easier.
